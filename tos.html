 <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: September 1, 2025</em></p>

  <p>
    These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Synq's website, mobile 
    application, and related services (the "Services"). By creating an account or 
    using the Services, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use 
    the Services.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
  <p>
    You must be 18 years or older (or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction, 
    if higher) to use the Services. If you are under 18, you may only use the Services 
    with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to these 
    Terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may not use the Services if you are a convicted sex offender, if we have 
    previously terminated your account, or if you are otherwise prohibited by law.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Account Registration & Security</h2>
  <p>
    You must provide true, accurate, and complete information and keep it current. 
    One personal account per user. Do not share your login credentials. You are 
    responsible for all activity under your account. Notify us immediately at 
    <strong>synq.app.contact@gmail.com</strong> if you suspect unauthorized access.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Use of Services</h2>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>use Synq for unlawful, fraudulent, or harmful purposes;</li>
    <li>harass, threaten, impersonate, or exploit others;</li>
    <li>post illegal, infringing, obscene, hateful, or unsafe content;</li>
    <li>upload viruses, malware, or interfere with the Services;</li>
    <li>scrape, collect, or harvest data without our permission;</li>
    <li>sell, transfer, or purchase accounts or user data; or</li>
    <li>misuse reporting or appeals systems.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We may suspend or terminate accounts or remove content that violates these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Events, Meetings & Assumption of Risk</h2>
  <p>
    Synq is a platform only. We do not organize, supervise, monitor, insure, or 
    control events, venues, or user interactions. We do not conduct background checks.
  </p>
  <p>By attending events, meeting users, or communicating through Synq, you agree that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>all activities are at your sole risk;</li>
    <li>
      Synq is not responsible for the conduct, identity, safety, legality, or 
      suitability of any user, event, or communication; and
    </li>
    <li>
      you release and forever discharge Synq and its affiliates from all claims, 
      demands, and damages, known or unknown, arising from or related to events, 
      meetings, or communications made through the Services.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Users and organizers are solely responsible for ensuring their activities comply 
    with applicable laws, safety standards, permits, and insurance. Synq is not a 
    party to agreements between users and provides no insurance.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Your use of Synq is subject to our Privacy Policy, which explains what data we 
    collect, how we use it, and your rights.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Content & Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    You own the content you post. By posting, you grant Synq a worldwide, non-exclusive, 
    royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable license to use, host, display, reproduce, 
    adapt, and distribute it in connection with operating the Services. This license 
    ends when you delete your content, subject to technical and legal retention.
  </p>
  <p>
    You represent that you have all rights to your content and waive moral rights to 
    the extent permitted by law.
  </p>
  <p>
    Synq owns all rights in its trademarks, logos, software, and content. You may not 
    use them without our written permission.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you believe your IP rights are infringed, contact 
    <strong>synq.app.contact@gmail.com</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The Services may link to or integrate with third-party apps or services. We are 
    not responsible for their content, practices, or performance. Dealings with third 
    parties are solely between you and them.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>
    THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT 
    PERMITTED BY LAW, SYNQ DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING 
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, Synq and its affiliates will not be liable 
    for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, 
    or for loss of profits, data, goodwill, or reputation, arising out of or related to 
    your use of the Services, whether online or offline.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our total liability for all claims relating to the Services will not exceed the 
    total amount you paid Synq for the Services in the twelve (12) months before the 
    event giving rise to the claim. If you paid nothing, our liability is $0.
  </p>
  <p>
    This limitation applies except to the extent that applicable law does not allow 
    such exclusions or limitations.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
  <p>
    You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Synq and its affiliates from any claims, 
    losses, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from: (a) your breach of these 
    Terms or law; (b) your content; or (c) your intentional misconduct or gross negligence.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Suspension & Termination</h2>
  <p>
    We may suspend or terminate your account or remove content if we reasonably believe 
    you violated these Terms, created risks, or if required by law. Provisions that by 
    nature should survive termination (Sections 4, 6, 8–11, and 13–14) remain in force.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms. If material changes are made, we will provide at least 
    30 days' notice in-app or by email. Continued use after the effective date means 
    you accept the new Terms. If you do not agree, stop using Synq and delete your account.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Governing Law & Disputes</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms are governed by the laws of Québec and the federal laws of Canada. 
    For consumers outside Québec, mandatory consumer laws of your jurisdiction may also apply.
  </p>
  <p>
    Disputes must first be attempted to be resolved informally within 30 days. If 
    unresolved, disputes will be brought exclusively in the courts of Montréal, Québec.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any claim must be filed within one (1) year of the event giving rise to it.
  </p>

  <h2>14. General</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Severability.</strong> If any part is unenforceable, the rest remains in effect.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>No waiver.</strong> Our failure to enforce is not a waiver of rights.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Entire agreement.</strong> These Terms plus our Privacy Policy form the 
    entire agreement.
