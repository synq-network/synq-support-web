      <h1>Release Notes</h1>
      <p><em>Welcome to the first release of Synq — the app that makes real-life connections through sports and activities.</em></p>

      <details class="rn-item" open>
        <summary>
          <span class="rn-ver">v1.0.0</span>

          <h2>About Synq</h2>
          <p>
            Synq is a social app built for people who want to connect in the real world 
            through sports and activities. Unlike traditional social networks, Synq is not 
            about endless scrolling or content feeds — it’s about meeting, playing, and 
            building community.
          </p>

          <h2>Core Features</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Events:</strong> Browse, create, and join sports and activity events. Choose a precise location when creating, but for security users will only see an approximate location until accepted.</li>
            <li><strong>Matching:</strong> Instead of matching with people, you match with events. If you and others join the same event, you become connected.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Scheduling:</strong> The app adapts event times to user time zones, and helps users balance their activities through a smart schedule engine.</li>
            <li><strong>Chats:</strong> Every event comes with its own chat. Users can also create team chats, discuss strategies, or even set up Pulse discussions. Private one-to-one and group chats are unified in one place (no split like other apps).</li>
            <li><strong>Moments:</strong> Share temporary stories inside chats, which can also be pushed to the Discover page to attract more participants or promote public events.</li>
            <li><strong>Discover Page:</strong> A swipeable card interface to discover people and events. Toggle between “People” and “Events.” Profiles include photo, name, age, location (approximate), availability, tags, and a user Pulse badge.</li>
            <li><strong>Flow Page:</strong> Your personal home feed of activity. Includes upcoming events, latest chats, active polls, friend activity (“Nick is playing basketball now”), and live bubbles of friends who are online now. Notifications only appear here to avoid distraction.</li>
            <li><strong>Profile (Me Page):</strong> Manage your profile, add friends, adjust settings. Friends can only be added by proximity (bringing phones together) or by participating in the same event.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Pulse System</h2>
          <p>
            Synq introduces <strong>Pulse</strong>, a credibility and activity score. Pulse 
            increases when you host or attend events, share moments, or contribute actively. 
            It helps build trust inside the community. Teams can also use Pulse in chats to 
            measure engagement and reliability.
          </p>

          <h2>Security & Verification</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Face Verification:</strong> Optional but available for higher trust. Users can verify their identity by matching a selfie with their profile picture.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Privacy:</strong> Event creators can pick the exact spot, but attendees only see an approximate area until they are confirmed. This prevents misuse and protects privacy.</li>
            <li><strong>No Content, No Noise:</strong> Synq avoids the clutter of traditional social networks. There are no likes, shares, or viral distractions — only real interactions around sports and activities.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Unique Differentiators</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Focuses 100% on offline interaction — real events, real friends, real activity.</li>
            <li>No lag, lightweight design with smooth real-time chats and event updates.</li>
            <li>Gamified trust system with Pulse, rewarding active and reliable users.</li>
            <li>Moments and events are tightly integrated, creating a cycle of discovery and engagement.</li>
            <li>Notifications centralized only in the Flow page, preventing app fatigue.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What’s Next</h2>
          <p>
            Future updates will add new features, improvements, and refinements. From here 
            on, all future versions will be logged in this Release Notes section so you can 
            track Synq’s evolution.
